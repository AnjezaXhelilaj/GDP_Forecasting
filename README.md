# 📊 GDP Forecasting Using ML Methods on Time Series Data

This project explores the use of various machine learning and statistical methods to forecast the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Albania 
using time series data collected from Eurostat. Our goal was to compare the performance of different models and evaluate their suitability for economic forecasting.

Overview

The project is structured around the implementation and comparison of the following models:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **VAR (Vector AutoRegression)**
- **Random Forest Regression**

Each model was trained on cleaned, seasonally adjusted macroeconomic indicators, with GDP as the main target variable. 
The performance of the models was compared using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and visualized through plots and residual analysis.

Techniques Used

- **Time Series Decomposition and Stationarity Checks**
- **ACF/PACF Plots and Lag Selection**
- **Data Preprocessing and Normalization**
- **Model Fitting and Evaluation**
- **Residual Diagnostics and Forecasting**
- **Feature Engineering**

> Note: Full implementation code may not be included due to this being a collaborative academic project.
